**SuperheroesMovieList** is an iOS app built with **SwiftUI** and **Combine**, following a clean **MVVM architecture** with a **state machine** for robust and scalable UI management.  

The project is designed with:
- Views are fully separated from business logic.  
- Networking is powered by a **custom layer** (no third-party dependencies).

##  Features
-  **Search**: Quickly find movies by title.  
-  **Sort**: Toggle ascending/descending by release year.  
-  **Infinite Scrolling**: Load more content as you browse.  
-  **State Machine**: Seamless transitions between loading, success, and error.  
-  **Detail View**: Bottom sheet presentation with `.presentationDetents`.  
-  **Accessibility Support**: Dynamic type, VoiceOver labels, and semantic UI.  
-  **Custom Networking Layer**: Built from scratch with `URLSession` and generics for decoding.

ðŸ“Œ Notes
While the original challenge specified three separate buttons (sort, order, and reset),
I made a design decision to merge sort and order into a single toggle by year.
This provides a cleaner UX without losing functionality, since the user can still switch between ascending and descending order intuitively.
